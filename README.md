Color Checker Application

A Python application written for a weekly challenge for my course in CODE University of Applied Sciences. 

The app requires a local CSV file with name and HEX values of colors. As the user inputs a value, the app scans through the CSV document and returns a feedback, with the information if the input was found in the document or not.
